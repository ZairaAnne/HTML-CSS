        My Jesus, my Savior
        Lord, there is none like You
        All of my days, I want to praise
        The wonders of Your mighty love

        My comfort, my shelter
        Tower of refuge and strength
        Let every breath, all that I am
        Never cease to worship You

        Shout to the Lord, all the earth, let us sing
        Power and majesty, praise to the King
        Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
        At the sound of Your name

        I sing for joy at the work of Your hands
        Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand
        Nothing compares to the promise I have in You
